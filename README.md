# Excel Automation with Python

Welcome to the Excel Automation with Python project. This project demonstrates how to automate Excel tasks using Python's `openpyxl` library.

## Overview

This project aims to streamline Excel-related processes using Python scripts. By leveraging the `openpyxl` library, we can manipulate Excel files, perform data analysis, and generate reports programmatically.

## Features

- Automate data entry and formatting tasks in Excel.
- Perform calculations, data manipulation, and analysis using Python.
- Generate dynamic charts and visualizations directly in Excel.
- Save time by avoiding manual data entry and repetitive tasks.

## Prerequisites

- Python (version X.X.X)
- `openpyxl` library (install using `pip install openpyxl`)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required dependencies using `pip install openpyxl`.
3. Run the Python scripts in the repository to see different Excel automation examples.
4. Modify the scripts to suit your specific use case and Excel files.
